# MY NEXT.JS JOURNEY
This project has been created to document my learning progress with Next JS.
I attempt everything that I learn here :) 

## Findings:
- Routing is file based 
- Nested routing = parent page goes in 'pages' folder, create new folder for child pages. Example: /blog = './pages/blog.js', /blog/first = './pages/blog/first.js'
