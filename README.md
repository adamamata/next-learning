# MY NEXT.JS JOURNEY
This project has been created to document my learning progress with Next JS.
I attempt everything that I learn here :) 

## Findings:
- Routing is file based.
- Nested routing = all pages with endpoint /blog go in the 'blog' folder. The root page is index.js.
- Dynamic Routing = example shown in the 'product' pages.
